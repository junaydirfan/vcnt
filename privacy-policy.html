    <h1>vcnt Discord Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>vcnt</strong>, the Discord bot that provides voice channel logging and other related services. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when using our bot. By inviting and using the bot in your server, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When using <strong>vcnt</strong>, the following types of data may be collected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Voice State Changes:</strong> When a user joins, leaves, or switches between voice channels, the bot collects data on these events.</li>
        <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> The unique ID of the user whose voice state changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> The ID of the voice channels that users join or leave.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We only collect this data to provide the logging functionality of the bot, and no additional personal data is collected.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The data we collect is used solely to log voice channel activities within the server where the bot is installed. This allows server admins to track when users join, leave, or move between voice channels. This data will not be used for any other purpose or shared with third parties unless required by law.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All collected data (voice state changes, user IDs, and channel IDs) is stored temporarily on the server where the bot is running. We do not retain data longer than necessary to provide the functionality of the bot. The data is deleted after it is used for logging purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the data collected by <strong>vcnt</strong> from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of the data.</p>

    <h2>6. Sharing of Data</h2>
    <p><strong>vcnt</strong> does not share your collected data with third parties unless:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is required by law or to comply with legal processes.</li>
        <li>The bot's functionality requires sharing data with trusted services (e.g., logging services, if applicable, though no personal data will be shared).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user of **vcnt**, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request that we delete your data from our logs.</li>
        <li>Request a copy of the data we have collected, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us directly via email or the support server.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>vcnt</strong> does not use third-party services for the collection or sharing of personal data. Any third-party services we may use are solely for the purpose of running the bot and may collect data only in accordance with their own privacy policies. However, we will never share your personal data with any third party for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. By continuing to use <strong>vcnt</strong> after such changes, you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: <strong>your-email@example.com</strong></li>
